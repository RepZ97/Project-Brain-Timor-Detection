# Project-Brain-Tumor-Detection
A brain tumor detection machine learning model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and transfer learning.

A brain tumor detection machine learning model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and transfer learning is a powerful tool that can accurately identify the presence of a tumor in brain scans.
Transfer learning helps to leverage the pre-existing knowledge of the CNN to improve the performance of the model on the specific task of brain tumor detection.
Overall, this model has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and speed of brain tumor diagnosis, enabling earlier detection and treatment.
Tensorflow has been used as the main library to develop this machine learning model.
